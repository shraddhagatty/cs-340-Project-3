We worked together to implement both algorithms helping one another implement and debug along the way. Shraddha speerheaded the link state node portion, while we familiarized ourselves with the framework and routing algorithms. Macy took more of a lead with the distance vector algorithm with Shraddha's help after she lead us through the link state node.
